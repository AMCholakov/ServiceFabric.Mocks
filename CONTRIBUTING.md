# Contribute!

Contributions are most welcome:

Please upgrade the package version with a minor tick if there are no breaking changes, by changing the <VersionPrefix>X.Y.Z</VersionPrefix> in the csproj file
Add a line to the readme.md, stating the changes, e.g. 'upgraded to SF version x.y.z'.
Doing so will allow me to simply accept the PR, which will automatically trigger the release of a new package. 
Please also make sure all feature additions are covered by corresponding unit tests.
